# RISC-V Assembler and Simulator

- This project includes a RISC-V assembler and simulator.
- They are written in **Python 3.13**.
- The framework implemented here is for **Python users on Linux or Windows only**.

---

## Project Structure

### Assembler Tests

Location: `tests/assembly/`

- `simpleBin/`, `hardBin/`, `errorGen/`: Input assembly code files.
- `bin_s/`, `bin_h/`: Expected machine code files corresponding to `simpleBin` and `hardBin`.
- `user_bin_s/`, `user_bin_h/`: Machine code generated by the assembler for `simpleBin` and `hardBin`, respectively.

### Simulator Tests

Location: `tests/bin/` and `tests/traces/`

- `tests/traces/`: Expected correct simulator traces.
- `tests/bin/`: Simulator traces generated by the simulator.

## How to Run

**Prerequisite:** Python3 must be installed on your device

### Running the Assembler

The assembler takes an assembly file as input and produces a machine code file.  

Navigate to `/automatedTesting` on your Terminal and run the following command to run the Assembler:

**Linux:**
```bash
python3 src/main.py --no-sim --linux
```
**Windows:**
```bash
python3 src\main.py --no-sim --windows
```  

### Running the Simulator  

Simulator takes a machine code file as input and produces a trace file as output. 

Navigate to `/automatedTesting` on your Terminal and run the following command to run the Simulator:

**Linux:**
```bash
python3 src/main.py --no-asm --linux
```
**Windows:**
```bash
python3 src\main.py --no-asm --windows
```
