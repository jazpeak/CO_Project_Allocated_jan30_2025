# RISC-V Assembler and Simulator

This project includes a RISC-V assembler and simulator along with a framework to test and validate their correctness.

## Project Structure

### Assembler Tests

Location: `tests/assembly/`

- `simpleBin/`, `hardBin/`, `errorGen/`: Input assembly code files.
- `bin_s/`, `bin_h/`: Expected machine code files corresponding to `simpleBin` and `hardBin`.
- `user_bin_s/`, `user_bin_h/`: Machine code generated by the student's assembler for `simpleBin` and `hardBin`, respectively.

### Simulator Tests

- `tests/bin/`: Simulator traces generated by the student's simulator.
- `tests/traces/`: Expected correct simulator traces.

**Note:**  
The assembly file and its corresponding machine code file **must have the same name** for the evaluation framework to function correctly.

## How to Use

This framework is for **Python users on Linux or Windows**.

### Running the Assembler

The assembler takes an assembly file as input and produces a machine code file.

**Linux:**
```bash
python3 src/main.py --no-sim --linux
```
**Windows:**
```bash
python3 src\main.py --no-sim --windows
```
